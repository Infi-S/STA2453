## Introduction

This project leverages sound data to perform fish classification using both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training scripts along with reproducible notebooks.

## Project Structure

- **Data**:  
  Due to file size limitations, processed data are not uploaded to GitHub. Instead, they can be found at:  
  [Processed Data](https://mega.nz/folder/8JYnwQKA#ODm-ycelxWaDrcM35pjqog)

- **Output**:  
  This folder includes both text and image outputs that are finally used in each report. Complete outputs can be found and reproduced by the notebooks in the **Script** folder.

- **Script**:  
  This folder contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and progress reporting.

- **Model**:  
  This folder includes scikit-learn models trained during research.
